# coin1
challenge coin with blinky lights

built as a stack of 3 PCBs -
components mounted on top of bottom board,
second board has a cutout to fit a battery and for each mounted component,
and top board has holes to transmit light from LEDs

finished coin to have [relatively] smooth top and bottom

using JLCPCB's serial-number mechanism to put a unique number on each coin
